# Using templates example

This is a spike to show how templates can be used to generate dashboards for
target environments:

To run:

```bash
bundler install
ruby lib/main.rb
```

This will produce an output directory and a number of files based of the
templates in ./dashboards

To run tests:

```bash
bundle exec rake
```
